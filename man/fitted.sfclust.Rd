\title{Fitted Values for \code{sfclust} Objects}
\usage{
\method{fitted}{sfclust}(x, sample = x$clust$id, sort = FALSE, aggregate = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class 'sfclust', containing clustering results and models.}

\item{sample}{An integer specifying the clustering sample number for which
the fitted values should be computed. The default is the \code{id} of the
current clustering. The value must be between 1 and the total number
of clustering (membership) samples.}
}
\value{
A matrix of fitted values, where each row corresponds to a data point
and each column corresponds to a cluster.
}
\description{
This function calculates the fitted values for a specific clustering sample in an
\code{sfclust} object, based on the estimated models for each cluster. The fitted
values are computed using the membership assignments and model parameters
associated with the selected clustering sample.
}
\details{
The function first checks if the provided \code{sample} value is valid (i.e., it is
within the range of available clustering samples). If the specified \code{sample}
does not match the current clustering \code{id}, the \code{sfclust} object is updated
accordingly. It then retrieves the membership assignments and cluster models
for the selected sample, calculates the linear predictions for each cluster,
and combines them into a matrix of fitted values.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'sfclust_obj' is a pre-existing sfclust object
fitted_values <- fitted.sfclust(sfclust_obj, sample = 3)
