\title{Plot function for sfclust objects with a conditional legend and log marginal likelihood}
\usage{
\method{plot}{sfclust}(
  x,
  sample = x$clustering$id,
  which = 1:3,
  clusters = NULL,
  sort = FALSE,
  legend = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample}{The row of the cluster matrix to use for plotting (default is the last row).}

\item{map}{An sf object provided by the user.}

\item{output}{An sfclust object containing the clustering results.}

\item{title}{A title for the plot (default is "Estimated Clusters").}
