\title{Plot Clustering Progress Over Iterations}
\usage{
plotClusterIter(cluster_out, height, filepath)
}
\arguments{
\item{filepath}{Character string specifying the path and name of the jpeg file to save the plot.}

\item{clust_res}{Matrix with rows representing iterations and columns representing membership indices,
showing the cluster assignment of each member at each iteration.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. The function's primary output is the generation of a jpeg file specified
by the \code{filepath}. The plot is saved directly to the file, and nothing is returned to the R environment.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the evolution of cluster memberships over iterations.
It creates a heatmap using the \code{fields} package to show how clusters change across
different iterations, saving the plot as a jpeg file.
}
\details{
The function uses \code{fields::image.plot} to create a heatmap where each column represents a member
and each row represents an iteration. The color in the heatmap represents the cluster to which
a member belongs in a given iteration. This visual representation helps in understanding
the stability and convergence of the clustering algorithm over time.

\examples{
# Assuming clust_res is a matrix where rows are iterations and columns are memberships:
\dontrun{
plotClusterIter(clust_res, "path/to/save/cluster_iterations.jpeg")
}
