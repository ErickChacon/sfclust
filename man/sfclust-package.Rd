\title{sfclust: Bayesian Spatial Functional Clustering}
\description{
The \code{sfclust} package implements the clustering algorithm proposed in \emph{"Bayesian
Spatial Functional Data Clustering: Applications in Disease Surveillance"}, available
at \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12633}. The package provides tools for performing
Bayesian spatial functional clustering, as well as methods for diagnostic analysis,
visualization, and summarization of results.
