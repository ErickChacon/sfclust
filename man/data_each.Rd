\title{This function preprocesses the data from a stars object by subsetting based on a cluster
and converting the data to a long format with proper indexing for time and spatial location.}
\usage{
data_each(x, k, membership, stnames = c("geometry", "time"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A stars object containing spatial-temporal dimensions defined in \code{stnames}.}

\item{k}{The cluster number to subset.}

\item{membership}{A vector defining the cluster membership for each region.}

\item{stnames}{The names of the \code{spatial} and \code{temporal} dimensions.}
}
\value{
A long-format data frame with ids for spatial and time indexing.
