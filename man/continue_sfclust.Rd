\arguments{
\item{result}{List containing results from a previous sfclust function, expected to include
a minimum spanning tree (\code{mst}) and cluster assignments.}

\item{data}{A stars object containing spatial data, including covariates and response variables.}

\item{graph}{Igraph object, a full graph to create MST.}

\item{formula}{An object of class \code{\link[stats]{formula}}, specifying the model used in the analysis.}

\item{family}{Character string specifying the family of distributions to use for the model.
Defaults to "normal".}

\item{q}{q is the penalty of the number of cluster.}

\item{correction}{Logical indicating whether correction for overdispersion or other factors
should be applied. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{niter}{Integer specifying the number of additional MCMC iterations to perform.}

\item{burnin}{Integer specifying the number of burn-in iterations to discard in this continuation.}

\item{thin}{Integer specifying the thinning interval for recording the results.}

\item{path_save}{Character string specifying the file path to save the continuation results.
If \code{NULL}, results may not be saved to file.}

\item{time_var}{The name of the time variable in the stars object.}

\item{N_var}{The name of the variable used as exposure or trials (for Poisson, binomial, etc.).}

\item{move_prob}{Numeric vector specifying the probabilities for different move types in the MCMC process.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying \code{sfclust} function.}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value within R but may output results to files if \code{path_save}
is specified. The results include updated cluster assignments and model parameters after
the additional MCMC iterations.
}
\description{
This function continues a Bayesian spatial fusion clustering (sfclust) process based on a previous result.
It is specifically designed to extend the MCMC iterations from a stopping point using the prior state
of cluster assignments and graphical model parameters.
}
\details{
The function takes the last state of the Markov chain from a previous \code{sfclust} execution and
uses it as the starting point for additional MCMC iterations. This is useful for extending
the analysis without restarting the process, thereby saving computational resources and time.
