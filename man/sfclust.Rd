\arguments{
\item{data}{A stars object contains response, covariates, and other needed data}

\item{formula}{A formula object representing the model to be fitted.}

\item{q}{q is the penalty of the cluster number.}

\item{burnin}{Integer, number of burn-in iterations to discard.}

\item{thin}{Integer, thinning interval for recording the results.}

\item{path_save}{Character, the path where results should be saved.}

\item{nsave}{the number of the gap of saved results in the chain.}

\item{move_prob}{a vector of probabilities of the birth, death, change steps.}

\item{graph}{Initial spanning tree used for the Bayesian model.}

\item{init_val}{List of initial values for parameters 'trees', 'beta', and 'cluster'.}

\value{
NULL The function primarily outputs results to a specified path and does not return anything.
}
\description{
This function implements a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm
for detecting spatial functional clusters based on a Bayesian analysis of spanning trees.
It handles various types of moves including birth, death, change, and hyperparameter updates
to explore the space of possible cluster configurations.
