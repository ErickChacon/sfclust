\title{Example Dataset: toy}
\format{
A list with 7 elements:
\describe{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix of observed functional responses. Each row represents a spatial location, and each column corresponds to a time point.}
\item{X1}{A numeric vector of the first covariate, representing spatially distributed explanatory data.}
\item{X2}{A numeric vector of the second covariate, representing additional spatial information.}
\item{map}{An \code{sf} object containing spatial geometries (e.g., polygons or points) that correspond to the locations of the data.}
\item{E}{A numeric vector representing the expected number of cases at each spatial location. This is used for modeling relative risk.}
\item{cluster}{An integer vector indicating the true cluster labels for each spatial location. Useful for validation and benchmarking.}
\item{eta}{A numeric vector representing the intensity parameter for \code{Y}. This characterizes the underlying process generating the functional responses.}
}

\usage{

\description{
A synthetic dataset used to demonstrate the functionality of the \code{sfclust} package.
This dataset contains spatially distributed functional data and associated attributes
for testing and illustrating spatial functional clustering methods.
