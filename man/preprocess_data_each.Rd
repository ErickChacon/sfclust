\title{This function preprocesses the data from a stars object by subsetting based on a cluster
and converting the data to a long format with proper indexing for time and spatial location.}
\usage{
preprocess_data_each(stars_obj, k, membership, time_var = "time")

preprocess_data_each(stars_obj, k, membership, time_var = "time")
}
\arguments{
\item{stars_obj}{A stars object containing spatial data.}

\item{k}{The cluster number to subset the data for.}

\item{membership}{A vector or matrix that defines cluster membership for each region.}

\item{time_var}{The name of the time variable (default is 'time').}
}
\value{
A long-format data frame with ids for spatial and time indexing, suitable for INLA.

A long-format data frame with ids for spatial and time indexing, suitable for INLA.
