\usage{
log_mlik_ratio(
  move,
  log_mlike_vec,
  proposed_move,
  stars_obj,
  formula,
  family = "normal",
  correction = FALSE,
  detailed = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{move}{A character string specifying the type of move; either "split" or "merge".}

\item{stars_obj}{A stars spatial temporal objects including responses, covariates, and other data.}

\item{formula}{An object of class \code{\link[stats]{formula}} specifying the model to be used in INLA.}

\item{family}{The family of distributions to use, e.g., "normal", "poisson", etc.}

\item{correction}{Logical, specifying whether correction calculations should be executed.}

\item{detailed}{Logical, indicating whether detailed output from INLA is required.}

\item{log_like_vec}{A numeric vector of existing log likelihoods for all clusters.}

\item{control.move}{A list containing control parameters and information about the move,
such as \code{clust_old}, \code{k}, \code{cluster_newid}, and \code{cluster_rm}.}

\item{time_var}{The name of the time variable in the stars object.}

\item{N_var}{The name of the variable used as exposure or trials (for Poisson, binomial, etc.).}
}
\value{
A list containing the updated log likelihood vector and the log likelihood ratio (\code{llratio}).
}
\description{
This function calculates the log-likelihood ratio for a proposed "split" or "merge"
move within a clustering or partitioning algorithm using the Integrated Nested
Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach. It updates local likelihoods based on
whether a split or merge operation has been proposed and supports multiple family
distributions.
