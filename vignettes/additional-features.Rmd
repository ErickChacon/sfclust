```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = "center")

```

In this vignette we present additional features of the `sfclust` package.

## Packages

We begin by loading the required packages.

```{r warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(sfclust)
library(stars)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Data

The simulated dataset used in this vignette, `stgaus`, is included in our package. It is
a `stars` object with one variable, `y`, and two dimensions: `geometry` and `time`. The
dataset represents the number of cases in 100 regions, observed daily over 91 days,
starting in January 2024.

```{r}
data("stgaus")
stgaus
```

To gain some initial insights, we can aggregate the data weekly:

```{r, fig.height = 5}
stweekly <- aggregate(stgaus, by = "week", FUN = mean)
ggplot() +
    geom_stars(aes(fill = y), stweekly) +
    facet_wrap(~ time, ncol = 5) +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "RdBu") +
    theme_bw()
```

We can also examine the trends for each region:

```{r, fig.height = 6}
stgaus |>
    st_set_dimensions("geometry", values = 1:nrow(stgaus)) |>
    as_tibble() |>
    ggplot() +
    geom_line(aes(time, y, group = geometry, color = factor(geometry)), linewidth = 0.3) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Some regions exhibit similar trends over time, but the overall patterns are more complex
than polinomial functions. Our goal is to cluster these regions while accounting for
spatial contiguity.

## Clustering

### Model

We assume that the response variable \( Y_{it} \) for region \( i \) at time \( t \) follows a normal distribution given the partition \( M \):
$$
Y_{it} \mid \mu_{it}, M \stackrel{ind}{\sim} \text{Normal}(\mu_{it}, \sigma^2),
$$
where the mean \( \mu_{it} \) is modeled based on the cluster assignment \( c_i \):
$$
\mu_{it} = \alpha_{c_i} + f_{c_i,t},
$$
where \( \alpha_{c_i} \) is the intercept for cluster \( c_i \), and \( f_{c_i,t} \) is a latent random effect modeled as a random walk process. Specifically, we impose the condition:
$$
f_{c_i,t} - f_{c_i,t-1} \sim N(0, \nu^{-1}), \quad \text{for } t = 2, \dots, n.
$$

The prior for the hyperparameter \( \nu_c \) is defined as:
$$
\log(\nu_c) \sim \text{Normal}(-2, 1).
$$

### Initial clustering

`sfclust` uses an undirected graph to represent connections between regions and proposes
spatial clusters using this graph through minimum spanning trees (MST). By default,
`sfclust` accepts the argument `graphdata`, which should include:

- An undirected `igraph` object representing spatial connections,
- An MST of that graph, and
- A `membership` vector indicating the initial cluster assignments for each region.

For simplicity, you can use the `genclust` function to generate an initial random
partitioning with a specified number of clusters. In this example, we create a partition
with 20 clusters:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
initial_cluster <- genclust(st_geometry(stgaus), nclust = 20)
names(initial_cluster)
```

Now, let's visualize how the regions were randomly clustered:

```{r, fig.height = 5.5}
st_sf(st_geometry(stgaus), cluster = factor(initial_cluster$membership)) |>
  ggplot() +
    geom_sf(aes(fill = cluster)) +
    theme_bw()
```

### Sampling with `sfclust`

We will initiate the Bayesian clustering algorithm using our generated partition
(`initial_cluster`). Additionally, we use the capabilites of `INLA::inla` to define a
model that includes a random walk process in the linear predictor, and custom priors for
the scale hyperparameter. To begin, we will run the algorithm for only 50 iterations.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# result <- sfclust(stgaus, graphdata = initial_cluster, niter = 50,
#     formula = y ~ f(idt, model = "rw1", hyper = list(prec = list(prior = "normal", param = c(-2, 1)))),
#   path_save = file.path("inst", "vigdata", "full-gaussian-mcmc1.rds"))
# system.time(
#   update(result, niter = 2000, path_save = file.path("inst", "vigdata", "full-gaussian-mcmc2.rds"))
# )
# #      user    system   elapsed
# # 16010.960 11900.949  2794.096
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# # Reduce size of object
# result1 <- readRDS(file.path("inst", "vigdata", "full-gaussian-mcmc1.rds"))
# result2 <- readRDS(file.path("inst", "vigdata", "full-gaussian-mcmc2.rds"))
# pseudo_inla <- function(x) {
#   list(
#     summary.random = list(id = x$summary.random$id["mean"]),
#     summary.linear.predictor = x$summary.linear.predictor["mean"]
#   )
# }
# result1$clust$models <- NULL
# result2$clust$models <- lapply(result2$clust$models, pseudo_inla)
# saveRDS(result1, file.path("inst", "vigdata", "gaussian-mcmc1.rds"))
# saveRDS(result2, file.path("inst", "vigdata", "gaussian-mcmc2.rds"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
result <- sfclust(stgaus, graphdata = initial_cluster, niter = 50,
    formula = y ~ f(idt, model = "rw1", hyper = list(prec = list(prior = "normal", param = c(-2, 1)))))
result
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
result <- readRDS(system.file("vigdata", "gaussian-mcmc1.rds", package = "sfclust"))
result
```

The output indicates that after starting with 20 clusters, the algorithm created 11 new
clusters (births), removed 6 clusters (deaths), changed the membership of 3 clusters, and
modified the minimum spanning tree (MST) 3 times.

The `plot` method allows us to select which graph to produce. For example, we can
visualize only the log marginal likelihood to diagnose convergence. With just 50
iterations, we can see that the log marginal likelihood has not yet achieved convergence.

```{r, fig.dpi = 72, fig.height = 6}
plot(result, which = 3)
```

### Continue sampling

To achieve convergence, we can continue the sampling using the `update` function and
specify the number of new iterations with the `niter` argument:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
result2 <- update(result, niter = 2000)
result2
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
result2 <- readRDS(system.file("vigdata", "gaussian-mcmc2.rds", package = "sfclust"))
result2
```

With 2000 additional iterations, there have been many clustering movements. Furthermore,
when visualizing the results, we can observe that the log marginal likelihood has achieved
convergence.

```{r, fig.dpi = 72, fig.height = 6}
plot(result2, which = 3)
```

## Results

The final iteration indicates that the algorithm identified 10 clusters, with a log
marginal likelihood of 12,708.35. The largest cluster consists of 27 regions, while the
smallest contains only one region.

```{r}
summary(result2, sort = TRUE)
```

Let's visualize the regions grouped by cluster.

```{r, fig.height = 5.5}
plot(result2, which = 1, sort = TRUE, legend = TRUE)
```

Let's visualize the original data grouped by cluster.

```{r, fig.height = 4}
stgaus$cluster <- fitted(result2, sort = TRUE)$cluster
stgaus |>
  st_set_dimensions("geometry", values = 1:nrow(stgaus)) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(aes(time, y, group = geometry), linewidth = 0.3) +
    facet_wrap(~ cluster, ncol = 5) +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(title = "Risk per cluster", y = "Risk", x = "Time")
```
